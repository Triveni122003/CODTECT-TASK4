Overview:
The goal of this project is to design and develop a computer vision system that can automatically detect and classify objects within images or video streams. The system will utilize deep learning techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy and efficiency.

Project: Automated Object Detection and Classification.

Objectives:
1. Object Detection: Develop a system that can accurately detect objects within images or video streams.
2. Object Classification: Classify detected objects into predefined categories (e.g., cars, pedestrians, animals, etc.).
3. Real-time Processing: Optimize the system for real-time processing to enable applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.

Methodology:
1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of images or video streams with annotated objects.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images.
3. Model Development: Develop a deep learning model using CNNs and transfer learning techniques.
4. Model Training: Train the model using the preprocessed data and evaluate its performance.
5. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a real-time environment for object detection and classification.

Expected Outcomes:
1. Accurate Object Detection: Achieve high accuracy in detecting objects within images or video streams.
2. Efficient Real-time Processing: Optimize the system for real-time processing to enable practical applications.
3. Robust Object Classification: Classify detected objects into predefined categories with high accuracy.

Applications:
1. Surveillance Systems: Enhance security surveillance systems with automated object detection and classification.
2. Autonomous Vehicles: Improve the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles with real-time object detection and classification.
3. Robotics: Enable robots to interact with their environment more effectively with automated object detection and classification.
